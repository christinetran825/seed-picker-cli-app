 (Amaranthus sp.) Direct seed or set young, growing amaranth transplants after danger of frost, in rich soil and full sun. Space 2-3 feet apart. Drought tolerant, but more productive with adequate moisture. Harvest young leaves for greens all summer long. Amaranth seeds mature over a long period, so must be collected several times for best production; or, cut and hang upside-down indoors, collecting seeds on a tarp as they fall. (Some threshing may be necessary.) This crop is easy to grow, quite colorful and makes delicious greens and grain. A good ornamental plant for landscaping.
